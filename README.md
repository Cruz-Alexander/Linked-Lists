# Linked List Implementations in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of basic and sorted linked lists, along with corresponding test cases.

## BasicLinkedList

`BasicLinkedList` is a basic implementation of a linked list with methods for adding elements to the front and end of the list, retrieving the first and last elements, removing elements, and more.

## SortedLinkedList

`SortedLinkedList` extends `BasicLinkedList` and represents a sorted linked list. It maintains elements in sorted order based on a provided comparator. Additionally, it overrides certain operations that are invalid for a sorted list.

## SampleDriver

`SampleDriver` is a sample Java program demonstrating the usage of `BasicLinkedList` and `SortedLinkedList`. It creates instances of both types of linked lists, performs various operations, and prints the results.

## Running the Sample Driver

To run the sample driver, execute the `main` method in the `SampleDriver` class. This will showcase the functionality of both `BasicLinkedList` and `SortedLinkedList`.

## Usage

Feel free to use and modify the linked list implementations according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue.
